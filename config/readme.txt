This repository is organized the following way:

- input: contains all Kubernestes resources we want to monitor and/or create using Policies

using Policy-Generator we dynamically create Policies - based on the input - for different standard.

in this example we use NIST and BSI-Grundschutz

Example:

EtcdEncryption is necessary for both standards.

but for NIST you need to set Control  A
while for BSI-Grundschutzt you need to set it under Control X
